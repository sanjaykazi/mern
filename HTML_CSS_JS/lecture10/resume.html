                        <p>I am a third-year UG student at IIT Bombay. Always looking forward to new learning and
                            experiences due to
                            my curious nature. Keeping myself well informed about the changing technologies and other
                            developments always
                            helps me in the long run. I found Data Science as the most exciting subject in my B-Tech
                            years and I want to
                            pursue my future in it. Coding has also interested me as I spend daily hours in it. Apart
                            from academia,
                            I am a nature lover and social worker. Achieving all this is the source of my constant
                            motivation.
